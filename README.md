# RUSLE
The first step is to load all the five factors data along with the study area files, in the repository of GEE. The basic work of creating the five factors can be done with ARCGIS software ie., R, K, LS, C, AND P.
The study area can be dfiened as a geometry at first or directly uploading teh shape file. If the study area is given as geometry, the zooming scale is to be considered. The zool level is within the range of 0 to 20, where 0 indicates the whole country and later one defining you region. Zoom into the region cetre and apply the zooming leve, where in the basci region zoom level faals highly between 6 to 10.
The next step is  to rename the 5 factors based on the imported assets.
Clip the region of intrest within the GEE, or one can mask the factors later when the calulated RUSLE output is derived.
The add layer scale depends on the study area, where in the range of pixel size can be adjusted accordingly.
